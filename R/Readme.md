# Firdeman_test,R
This R script is for project about using machine learning algorithms and fine geo-resolution data to predict crash spots.

I worte Friedman tests and Nemenyi tests from scratch.
 
I also implemented boosted decision tree and logistic regression models with lasso penalty in the script.
